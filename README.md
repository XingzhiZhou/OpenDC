# OpenDC: An open source toolkit for Deep Clustering (under construction)
This repository OpenDC(open deep clustering) aims to build a platform for deep clustering algorihtm, including datasets, baselines and evaluation methods. This work is inspired by OpenNE.

We try to unify procedures of recent popular models on deep clustering, and provide effective evaluation methods and visualization for better understanding of deep clustering algorihtm.  

Clustering and classification are two fundamental questions in machine learning. With the rapid development of deep learning, clustering is meeting with a new challenge and chance to get better performance. 

To accelerate the development, the most data styles and classes will refer to github package [vlukiyanov/pt-dec](https://github.com/vlukiyanov/pt-dec). 

Architecture of OpenDC will be three parts:	datasets, models, evaluation. Evaluation includes the record of criterion and picture printing. 

Three Key Evaluation methods
NMI
Adjust Rand Index
Aligned classification error

Good ways to visualization:
t-Sne, UMAP

Good Datasets
MNIST 
STL-10
